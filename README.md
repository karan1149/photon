# Photon

Photon is a menu bar application for macOS that magically sets the screen
brightness based on your screen contents.

**You control Photon simply by using your brightness keys - it'll automatically
learn your preferences.**

Photon will automatically brighten the screen when you're looking at a dark
window (for example, a full-screen terminal) and it'll automatically darken the
screen when you're looking at a bright window (for example, a web browser).
This makes for a much more pleasant experience, especially at night.

## Demo

![Demo][demo]

Without Photon, web pages are too bright, and the terminal is too dark to read.
With Photon, it's perfect.

## Download

The easiest way to install Photon is to use [Homebrew Cask][cask]:

```bash
brew cask install lumen
```

Cask makes it easy to manage updates too.

If you prefer, you can manually install the binary. You can find pre-built
binaries [here][releases].

**As of now, releases are not signed with a developer key. To open unsigned
applications, use [this method][opening-unsigned].**

You can also download and compile the code yourself, if you feel like it.

**Note: Photon isn't supposed to work with auto brightness enabled, so be sure
to disable the "automatically adjust brightness as ambient light changes"
feature in System Preferences.**
